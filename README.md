# Speech Emotion Recognition with Python 🎤🔊

## Introduction 🚀
Welcome to the Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project! This project aims to recognize human emotions and affective states from speech using machine learning techniques. By analyzing audio features such as tone and pitch, we can infer underlying emotions expressed in speech.

## What is Speech Emotion Recognition? 🗣️👂
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the process of identifying and classifying human emotions and affective states from speech signals. This involves analyzing various acoustic features such as pitch, intensity, and timbre to infer the emotional state of the speaker. SER has applications in fields like human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and psychological research.  

## Dataset 📊📈
For this project, we'll be using the RAVDESS dataset (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song). This dataset contains labeled audio samples of human speech portraying various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. The dataset is widely used for research in speech emotion recognition and contains a diverse range of emotional expressions.  

## Dependencies 🛠️📦
To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:  

• librosa  
• soundfile  
• numpy  
• sklearn  
• pyaudio  
You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install librosa soundfile numpy sklearn pyaudio
```
