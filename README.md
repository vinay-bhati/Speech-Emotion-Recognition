# Speech Emotion Recognition with Python 🎤🔊

## Introduction 🚀
Welcome to the Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project! This project aims to recognize human emotions and affective states from speech using machine learning techniques. By analyzing audio features such as tone and pitch, we can infer underlying emotions expressed in speech.

## What is Speech Emotion Recognition? 🗣️👂
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the process of identifying and classifying human emotions and affective states from speech signals. This involves analyzing various acoustic features such as pitch, intensity, and timbre to infer the emotional state of the speaker. SER has applications in fields like human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and psychological research.  

## Dataset 📊📈
For this project, we'll be using the RAVDESS dataset (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song). This dataset contains labeled audio samples of human speech portraying various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. The dataset is widely used for research in speech emotion recognition and contains a diverse range of emotional expressions.  

## Dependencies 🛠️📦
To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:  

• librosa  
• soundfile  
• numpy  
• sklearn  
• pyaudio  
You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install librosa soundfile numpy sklearn pyaudio
```

## Model Architecture 🧠💻
In this project, we'll be using an MLPClassifier (Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier) from the sklearn library. MLPClassifier is a type of feedforward neural network that can be trained to classify data into multiple classes. We'll extract features from audio samples using librosa, preprocess the data, and then train the MLPClassifier to recognize emotions from speech.  

## Getting Started 🚀🔍
• **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

• **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries using pip as mentioned above.

• **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.

• **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Launch JupyterLab by running the command:
```
jupyter lab
```
This will open a new session in your browser.

• **Execute Code Cells**: Open the Jupyter Notebook file and execute the code cells sequentially to run the project.

## Future Work 🔮📈
1. Explore advanced feature extraction techniques for better emotion recognition.
2. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and architectures to improve model performance.
3. Collect and annotate additional speech datasets to enhance model training and generalization.

## Conclusion 🎉🔍
Speech Emotion Recognition is an important task with numerous applications in human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and mental health assessment. By leveraging machine learning techniques and audio processing libraries, we've developed a model capable of recognizing emotions from speech with reasonable accuracy. This project provides a solid foundation for further research and development in the field of affective computing.

Thank you for your interest in the Speech Emotion Recognition project!
